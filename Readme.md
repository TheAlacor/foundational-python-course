# Foundational Python Course

## First Section – Basics

## Summarise of what I did for now **(24/12/2025)**

This repository documents my progress in a foundational Python course. So far, I have focused on learning core Python concepts, starting with the use of the `print()` function to display different data types such as strings, integers, and floats. I also practiced using the `type()` function to identify data categories.

In addition, I explored several types of operators, including assignment, comparative, and mathematical operators. I then moved on to basic control flow using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements. Finally, I worked with essential list methods to add, remove, search, and sort values.

Error occured in section_3, as I forgot to commit the changes for this section.  
Section 4 was completed with no issues, I learn about lists and dictionaries, and different types of data structure.

## Summarise of what I did for now **(01/01/2026)**

So far, I've been researching about tuples and sets (uses, methods, differences). Next, I investigated about loops like `for` and `while`.

The last things I look for was functions and a bit of POO. In POO I learned about classes, methods, constructor, public, private and protected methods, as well as `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`.
