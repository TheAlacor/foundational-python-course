# Foundational Python Course

## First section - Basics

## Summarise of what I did for now**(24/12/2025)**
To start, I've been learning the basics of Python, such as displaying different data types like strings, integers, and floats using the print() function. I also practiced using type() to identify data categories. Next, I explored various operators—including assignment, comparative, and mathematical ones. I then moved on to control flow with if, else, and elif statements. Finally, I learned how to use essential list methods to add, remove, search, and sort values.

Error occured in section_3,I forgot to do the commit from this section.
Section 4 finished with no issues,I learn about list and dictionaries,different types of data structure.
