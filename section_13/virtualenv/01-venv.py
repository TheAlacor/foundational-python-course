# after creating your virtual environement you need to activate it,so first,write in the terminal "venv/Scripts/activate" if you are a window user, or "Source venv/bin/activate" if you are a linux or Mac user.Then you can install packages in the virtual environement
# If you want to leave the environemnt you only need to use the command "deactivate"

# in my case I couldn't use the command because I didn't have the scripts execution enabled
# use command "pip freeze > requirements.txt" with the objective of create a archive where you can show the packages and version to other people easily downloading the archive
